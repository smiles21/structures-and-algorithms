# Binary Search

Binary Search is a search algorithm which retutns the index of an element.
Binary Search does not guarantee to return a specific index if multiple of the
same element exist in the list.  There are extensions possible to allow for this
case.

## Usage

### `binarySearch(list, value)`

Returns the index of the value in the list, or -1 if the value is not present in
the list
