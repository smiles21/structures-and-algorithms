# Stack

A Stack is a data structure which implements a Fist-In-Last-Out order of
elements. Think of it as similar to dinner plates stacked on top of each other.
The last one that is placed on the top is the first one to be removed if we pull
just one off.

## Methods

### `push(value)`

Push a new value to the top of the Stack

### `pop()`

Remove the top element from the top of the Stack and return it. Calling `pop` on an empty Stack returns `undefined`.

### `peek()`

Return the top element of the Stack but do not remove it. Calling `peek` on an empty Stack returns `undefined`.

### `isEmpty()`

Return `true` if the Stack has no elements in it, `false` if there is at least
one element
